# 3dapter (formerly Triple Controller to USB)

This project combines the NES, SNES and Genesis DaemonBite Retro Controllers projects together with a custom PCB to support 3 different controllers with a single socketed Arduino Pro Micro. PCB (KiCad + Gerbers), 3D Cases, and muliple firmware versions (Arduino code) all available in this repository.

PCB Kits + Fully Assembled units (with firmware of your choice) available on [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/24994/)

3 different firmware versions are available in this repo:
* Default: Optimized for MiSTer, PC, Raspberry Pi, etc. - reports as 3 separate controllers, supports multiplayer from a single unit.
* Analogue Pocket: Optimized for Pocket Dock - reports as a single wired XInput device.
* Nintendo Switch: Optimized for Nintendo Switch Online NES, SNES, and Genesis collections - reports as a single wired switch controller.
